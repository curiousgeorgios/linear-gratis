3. Maintaining context and customer info
4. Eliminating copy-paste workflows

- Zero manual copying
- Single source of truth for feedback

### 4. "Open source vs proprietary: Why linear.gratis chose transparency"

We chose open source because:

**Transparency builds trust**
- You can see exactly how your data is handled
- No hidden analytics or tracking

**No vendor lock-in**
- Self-host if you want
- Fork and customise as needed
- Never worry about pricing changes

**Community-driven features**
- Features built for real user needs
- Fast response to issues
- Collective ownership

**Sustainable development**
- Not dependent on VC funding
- Can't be acquired and shut down
- Long-term stability

This is why linear.gratis will always be free and open source.
